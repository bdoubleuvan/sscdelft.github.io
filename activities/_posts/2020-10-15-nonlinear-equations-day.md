The SIAM Student Chapter at [TU Delft] is organizing a **Non-Linear Equations Workshop Day** which is going to take place on 15 October. However, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, we will organize it **online via Zoom from 1030 to 1545**.


There will be 3 minisymposiums and 1 BaNaNa Talk during the workshop day, in which we will have the presentations regarding non-linear equations in **finance, power flow, combustions** and **G+smo**. 

Here comes the program of the workshop day:

|10:30 - 10:40 | Opening and Introduction to [SIAM-SC TUDelft]
|10:40 - 11:25 | Non-Linear Equations in Finance: [Prof.dr.ir. C.W. Oosterlee]
|11:25 - 11:50 | Non-Linear Equations in Finance: [B. Boonstra]
|11:50 - 12:20 | BaNaNa Talk: [H.M. Verhelst]
|12:20 - 13:00 | Non-Linear Equations in Combustions: [Dr. B. Cuenot]
|13:45 - 14:10 | Non-Linear Equations in Combustions: [R. Sampat]
|14:10 - 14:25 | Coffee Break
|14:25 - 15:10 | Non-Linear Equations in Power Flow: [Dr.ir. J.L. Rueda Torres]
|14:25 - 15:10 | Non-Linear Equations in Power Flow: [Dr.ir. B. Sereeter]
|15:35 - 15:45 | End
