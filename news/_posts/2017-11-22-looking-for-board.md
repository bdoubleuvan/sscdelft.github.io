Dear SIAM Student Chapter members,

In the previous years the SIAM Student Chapter Delft has organised a multitude of activities, such as workshop days, BBQs, movie nights, company visits, baNaNa talks and chess tournaments. To make such activities happen next year as well, we are looking for a new board for 2018!

As a board member, you will be able to choose and organize these activities (and others) yourself with your fellow board members. This is a great opportunity to get some non-scientific experience during you PhD.

If you might be interested and want some more information about being a board member of the SIAM Student Chapter Delft, join our interest lunch on Wednesday November 29th at 12.00 in meetingroom 1.4 of EWI (LB 01.210). Lunch will be provided. Please let us know if you're coming by filling in the [doodle]: 

Anne Markensteijn,
SIAM SC Delft
