Dear all,

The SIAM student chapter will organize a chess tournament on the evening of March 31st. Everyone is welcome to play: 
whether youâ€™re a beginner or an advanced player, as long as you know the chess rules(!). This is your chance to learn to 
play in competition, remove the rust, or just kick some chess! The winner gets a price and will compete against dr.ir. [Martin van Gijzen]!

Please add your name to the [doodle] list or reply to this [email] if you would like to join the tournament.
