Dear members,

Boost your mathematical creativity and join us on our excursion! 
During the afternoon on Friday, July 1, the SIAM Student Chapter invites you to the Escher museum in The Hague.
During this excursion we will explore Escher’s paintings and the math behind them. We will leave the faculty building at 14.00 and 
go to the museum with public transport. Entry to the museum will be free of charge for the first 18 participants. 
You can sign up via the [doodle].

Here is a [link] discussing some of the mathematical background of Escher’s work with a focus on Hyperbolic Geometry.
