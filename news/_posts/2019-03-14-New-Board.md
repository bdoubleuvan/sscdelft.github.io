The new board for the year 2019 was announced in February 2019. The details of the board members can be found on the left side panel of this page. We look forward to another year of enthusing movie nights, exciting chess tournaments, interesting BaNaNa talks, etc. This time around we will have some new fun-filled activities. So stay tuned to our news! Meanwhile, we are always open to new suggestions and ideas, and of course, new members too! Just drop us an email to [SIAMSC-EWI@tudelft.nl].
