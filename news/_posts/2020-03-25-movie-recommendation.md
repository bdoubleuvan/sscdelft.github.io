Due to the circumstance of corona virus, unfortunately, we are not able to organize the usual movie night. However, to keep the spirit up, we will recommend movies regularly. 

Today we want to recommend **The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz (2014)**.

Aaron Swartz had several roles like a computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist. One of the most significant roles is a "free culture activist". He campaigned for open access to academic research, which also got him in the most trouble in the end.  Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment, where he had hanged himself in 2013.
