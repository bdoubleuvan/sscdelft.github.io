We held our annual workshop day on **May 29th**. This time the topic was *Numerical Optimization*. We had speakers from the Netherlands, Belgium and Serbia who gave talks on various numerical optimization techniques they use in the day to day work. The applications varied from reservoir modelling, additive manufacturing, image retrievals from telescope to even the modern autonomous driving. Along with applied talks, there were quite a few interesting talks on theoretical aspects of optimization. The workshop's affinity amongst its attendees was due the fact that it had something for everyone.

We would like to thank all our speakers for the wonderful and interesting talks.
