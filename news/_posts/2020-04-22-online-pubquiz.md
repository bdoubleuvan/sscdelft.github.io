We had our first time online pub quiz ever due to the COVID-19 situation. There were 2 teams of 8 people joining us to have fun together.


The score of the two teams were very close. The team of **Amey Vasulkar, Mike Zoutendijk, Jenny Tjan, and Frida Viset** won the game with a full score of the last section. Congratulations guys!


The prize will be distributed once we are allowed to work in the office again. Before that, we will try to organize other events online. Hope to see you there!
