The next movie night is at Thursday September 21 at 6.00 PM at the Van Katwijkzaal. We will watch the movie ‘Hidden Figures’ which is based on the non-fiction book with the same name, about African American female mathematicians working at NASA during the space race. Free drinks and popcorn will be provided and there is a possibility to order food.
