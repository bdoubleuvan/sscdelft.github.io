Dear SIAM member,

How many digits of Pi do you know? Can you name all the countries of Europe? Or can you solve a nasty integral?
 
The SIAM student chapter will organize a pub quiz on the evening of November 24th. Everyone is welcome to join!
Drinks and snacks will be provided and the winning team will get a price!

Please, let us know at [doodle] if you'll join. For more info see the [flyer](http://sscdelft.github.io/images/pubQuizFlyer2016-11-24.pdf).
