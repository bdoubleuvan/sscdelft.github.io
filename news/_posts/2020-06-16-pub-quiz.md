We hope you all are healthy, safe, and doing well.


It seems like we have to continue organizing our fun activities virtually before we can see each other in our beloved university.


How fast can you still do high school mathematics? Are you up for the challenge?
Here is the invitation for the Online Mathematical Pub Quiz :).


Four groups of 4-5 members will be competing against each other. Therefore, we have only 20 positions, which are given on the basis of first come first serve! The quiz is scheduled on **Thursday, 25/06/2020**. Two groups will start at 19.00 and the other two groups will start at 20.00.  Each group will have a skype call with one of the board members.

We give you the choice to make your own team. Please coordinate with each other for making teams. Please fill the following [google form] to register. If you do not manage to form a team, that's okay, mention it in the form and we will accommodate you in some team.

The winning team will be rewarded once we are back to the office :)

So are you interested in testing your mathematics skills? We are looking forward to meeting you virtually. ðŸ˜Š
