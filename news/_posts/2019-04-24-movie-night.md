So we will have our first event for this year- THE MOVIE NIGHT. We will be watching a British drama film, **X+Y**. It was released in the US as **A brilliant young mind**. The streaming will be in Building 28, room 2W.950 at 6pm. There will be snacks and drinks and a possibility to order pizza depending on the number of people. Do come!!!
