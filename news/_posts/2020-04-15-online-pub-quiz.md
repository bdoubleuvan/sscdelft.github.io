We hope you are all doing well!

Start getting bored with working from home? Miss the time you hang out with others? Let's have some fun during this circumstances :D

We will organize an online pub quiz via Skype. Three groups of 4-5 members will be competing against each other. Therefore, **only 15 positions**, who comes first who gets it!

Every group will have a skype call with one of the board members. The quiz will be the same for all three groups and will be held in parallel.

Time: Wednesday, April 22, 2020 at 1900
