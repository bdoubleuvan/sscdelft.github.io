Dear all,

Hard day at work and in the mood to lay back? Please join us at this returning event showing that mathematics can also be relaxing:

The M2 nights (Movie and Mathematics) are organised multiple times a year to allow colleagues to gather for a drink (and popcorn) 
while enjoying the beauty of mathematics after a hard day of scientific work. The next M2 night is at Thursday July 7 at 6:30 PM at EWI, Snijderszaal. Free drinks and popcorn will be provided. Also, it is 
possible to order food.

Please, let us know if you'll join at: [doodle]. For more info visit our [homepage] or see the [flyer](http://sscdelft.github.io/images/movieNightFlyer2016-07-07.pdf).
