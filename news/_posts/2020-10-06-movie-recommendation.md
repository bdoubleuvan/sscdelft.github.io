title: "M=O(V+I^E) Recommendation: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)"
---

Today, the movie we want to recommend is **2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)**.

This movie was released in 1968 and turns out to be way ahead of time. The movie is based on the science fiction novel written by Arthur C. Clarke and is directed by Mr. Stanley Kubrick.

HAL 9000, a supercomputer on a spacecraft heading to Jupiter is in charge of most operations, which leads to terrifying events when it glitches and decides to destroy the world. As HAL kills off the crew one by one, we are reminded of the dangers of letting AI take control of our world and be mindful of the consequences. 
With the exponential growth in the development of AI, it is interesting to see the thoughts around AI that were established in 1960s. 

"Let the Awe and Mystery of a Journey Unlike Any Other Begin".

We hope you enjoy the movie. Please reach out to us if you come across movies/books that are related to science that you would like to recommend to your colleagues.
