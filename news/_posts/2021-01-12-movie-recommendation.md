Wish you a happy and prosperous new year! The year was indeed a roller coaster ride for everyone. Unfortunately, we could meet only once for our usual Movie Night last year. However, as the new tradition, we would like to recommend you another movie to start a new year with some dramatic film of a genius mathematician. As quoted in the movie,
''You'll have bad times, But it'll always wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to.''

We would like to recommend a movie named **Good Will Hunting** that quotes this life lesson. This movie was released in 1997 and states a story of high school dropout that scribbles down the answers to questions of a great mathematician.  With the natural gift of intellect, the protagonist (Will Hunting) of the movie struggles throughout the movie due to child abuse. As a part of deferred prosecution for insulting police officer, Will studies advanced mathematics with the renowned professor that discovers the Will's talent. He also undergoes therapy in which he reshapes his life by confronting his past life and keeping a futuristic view.

We hope you enjoy the movie. Thank you Dr Kristof Cools for recommending this movie.
Please reach out to us if you come across movies/books that are related to science that you would like to recommend to your colleagues.
