Stay too long alone and miss the time you spend with your friends? Perhaps you can invite your friends to watch this movie together via skype, then "tag" each other when we are out of this circumstance.   

Today, the movie we want to recommend is **Tag (2018)**.

A small group of former classmates organize an elaborate, annual game of tag that requires some to travel all over the country. The film is based on a true story that was published in The Wall Street Journal about a group of grown men, played by Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, and Jeremy Renner, who spend one month a year playing the game of tag. "It (The game) is not about trying to get away from each other. Itâ€™s actually about having a reason to be around each other. "

Any friend pops up in your mind now? Then call them and find a time to watch this together :)
