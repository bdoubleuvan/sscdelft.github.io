I hope you all are safe and healthy. 

After the rocking evening with participants of the Online pub quiz, we have been encouraged to organize another fun event. This time with "Online Pictionary"  ðŸ˜Š

We have found an online platform where 12 people can be accommodated at one time. Each person will be given options of 3 words out which he/she can choose 1 word. The chosen word will be described through pictures to the rest of the 11 participants. The person guessing the word will be given points. If the word is guessed by any of the participants then the person describing the word will also be given points.  The person with maximum points wins.

We will have the event on Wednesday, 27/05/2020 starting from 1900. Please fill the following doodle form if you wish to participate. 

Here comes the link to register: https://doodle.com/poll/i34r2emqe8nqaczd

If most of you agree, we can also have a video call in parallel.

So are you interested in joining this another experiment? We are looking forward to meeting you there :D

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the event, please don't hesitate to contact us by replying to this email.
