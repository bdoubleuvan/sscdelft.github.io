title: "M=O(V+I^E) Recommendation: The Imitation Game (2014) --- A movie about Alan Turing"           
---

Today, the movie we want to recommend was played before at our usual movie night. Personally, we still think, it is worth to watch again. Since without Alan Turing, I am afraid we would suffer much more during this "new normal life". 

**The Imitation Game (2014)** is based on the 1983 biography Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges. The movie title is taken from the name of the game Alan Turing proposed for answering the question "Can machines think?", in his 1950 seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". In 1939, newly created British intelligence agency MI6 recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing to crack Nazi codes, including Enigma -- which cryptanalysts had thought unbreakable. Turing's team, including Joan Clarke, analyze Enigma messages while he builds a machine to decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become heroes, but in 1952, the quiet genius encounters disgrace when authorities reveal he is gay and send him to prison.

We hope you will enjoy this movie. If you have any movie or book you want to share with us, please don't hesitate to send us an email.
