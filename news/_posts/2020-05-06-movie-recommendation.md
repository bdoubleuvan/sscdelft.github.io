Today, the movie we want to recommend is **A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)**.

Based on the 1969 short story "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long" by Brian Aldiss, this science fiction fantasy bears similarities to Pinocchio (1940) and originated as a long-gestating project of director Stanley Kubrick that passed to his friend Steven Spielberg after Kubrick's death. Haley Joel Osment stars as David Swinton, a young boy of the future, living in a time when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities. It's also a time when humans live side by side with "mechas," or sentient robots. When David, a highly advanced robotic boy, discovers that he is not the biological son of his parents, he sets out to learn what he can of his true nature. He soon embarks on a journey to make his dreams come true.

Do you think that the robot can have emotions as human beings or it is simply the result of an advanced program?
