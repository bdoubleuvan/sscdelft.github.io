title: "Online Pictionary on Wednesday 16 Sept 2020"
---

After the first tryout of online Pictionary and receiving a lot of positive feedback, we have been encouraged to organize it again!

We have found an online platform where 12 people can be accommodated at one time. Each person will be given options of 3 words out which he/she can choose 1 word. The chosen word will be described through pictures to the rest of the 11 participants. The person guessing the word will be given points. If the word is guessed by any of the participants then the person describing the word will also be given points.  The person with maximum points wins.

We will have the event on Wednesday, 16/09/2020 starting from 1900. Due to the time limitation of the Pictionary website, please join the following zoom meeting first:

Time: Sep 16, 2020 07:00 PM Amsterdam
